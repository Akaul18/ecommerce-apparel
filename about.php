A designer is a catalyst, a medium who brings form to the formless, someone who peers into the mindscapes of generations and pulls out a creation from the void. I am nothing but this, and I humbly accept my destiny.<br><br>My name is Esha Koul, and I am catalyst for creations that celebrate and represent the multi-cultural and multi-faceted lifestyles of all women, women who believe in the elegant and luxurious, the timeless, the emotional, the caring, the bewitching, the angelic, the sinful, and finally, the enlightening.
			My focus is on fine tailoring and suave cuts, incorporating traditional Indian embroideres, embellished in a refined modern approach. Paying tribute to Indian craftsmanship , clearly evident in its flouncy drapes and silhouettes. In sync with global trends, the label exhibits a mix of contemporary fabrics and a vivid color palette.<br><br>ESHA KOUL is an upcoming Delhi based designer.
